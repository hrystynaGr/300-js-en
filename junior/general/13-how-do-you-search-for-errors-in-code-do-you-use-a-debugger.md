### How to search for errors in code? Do you use a debugger?

There are few main ways to seach for errors.
1. **Dev Tools:** For web applications, modern browsers offer developer tools that include a console to view errors and inspect code.
2. **Debugger:** Debugging tools like those in integrated development environments (IDEs) allow you to step through your code, set breakpoints, and examine variable values, making it easier to pinpoint errors.
3. **Alerts/Console Logs:** Adding strategic alert() or console.log() statements can help you check the state of variables and flow of execution in your code.
4. **Linter:** Utilizing a linter tool, such as ESLint for JavaScript, helps identify coding style issues and potential errors in your code based on predefined rules.
5. **Tests:** Writing unit tests and integration tests can systematically verify that your code functions as expected. Testing frameworks like Jest for JavaScript or Pytest for Python can be valuable for this.
