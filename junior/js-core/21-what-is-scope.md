### What is scope?

**Scope** - context in which variables or other structures are defined and can be accessed.
There are two main types of scope in JS.
1. **Global Scope** (object window) - Variables or functions declared outside of any function or code block are said to have global scope. Variables declared with the var keyword at the top level are global, while those declared with let or const are not accessible outside the script file.
2. **Local Scope** - variables or functions declared within a function or a code block (loops, conditionals, and other code blocks) have local scope.
