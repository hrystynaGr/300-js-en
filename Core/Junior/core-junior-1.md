### Which HTTP methods do you know?

- **GET** - Used for retrieving information from the server.
- **PUT** - Used for sending information to the server (changing records).
- **POST** - Used for sending information to the server (adding records).
- **DELETE** - Used for deleting information from the server.

> If you send a PUT request several times, the result will be the same; however, POST may create duplicate entries.
> POST is safer than GET because the data you send is not visible in the URL, is not stored in the browser's history, and is not saved in logs.
